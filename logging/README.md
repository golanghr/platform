# [Golang.hr] Platform logging package
Base logging package (more like helper) for [Golang.hr Platform]. We are using [Logrus].

More info about [Logrus]:

```
Logrus is a structured logger for Go (golang), completely API compatible with
the standard library logger. Godoc.
Please note the Logrus API is not yet stable (pre 1.0).
Logrus itself is completely stable and has been used in many large deployments. 
The core API is unlikely to change much but please version control your Logrus
to make sure you aren't fetching latest master on every build.
```
